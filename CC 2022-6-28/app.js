// Note: This kata is inspired by Convert a Number to a String!. Try that one too.

// Description
// We need a function that can transform a string into a number. What ways of achieving this do you know?

// Note: Don't worry, all inputs will be strings, and every string is a perfectly valid representation of an integral number.

// first attempt

// p: function must take in a string
// r: function gives out a number
// Examples
// "1234" --> 1234
// "605"  --> 605
// "1405" --> 1405
// "-7" --> -7
// p: 
// create a function
// use js to convert from string to number
// return number

const stringToNumber = function(str){
    return null-'';
  }

// This is the opposite of what we saw in the "number to string" challenge so I thought this would work, but for some reason it doesn't seem to work. maybe I'm using the wrong subtract sign for javascript?
